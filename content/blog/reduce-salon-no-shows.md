No-shows cost salons thousands per year in lost revenue. Here's how to reduce them by 40% or more.

## The True Cost of No-Shows

When a client doesn't show up for their appointment, you're not just losing the service fee. You're losing:

- **Time slots** that could have been filled by other clients
- **Product preparation** that goes to waste
- **Staff time** spent waiting for clients who never arrive
- **Revenue** that's impossible to recover

For a typical salon, no-shows can cost £5,000-£15,000 annually.

## Strategy 1: Automated SMS Reminders

The single most effective way to reduce no-shows is automated reminders.

**Best practices:**
- Send first reminder 48 hours before appointment
- Send second reminder 2-4 hours before appointment
- Include booking details and cancellation link
- Personalize with client name and stylist

**Results:** Salons using automated reminders see 35-40% reduction in no-shows.

## Strategy 2: Deposit Requirements

For high-value services (£50+), require a small deposit.

**Implementation tips:**
- Charge 20-30% upfront
- Make it refundable if canceled 24+ hours in advance
- Use automated payment collection
- Clearly communicate policy on booking page

## Strategy 3: Easy Cancellation Process

Make it easy for clients to cancel or reschedule.

**Why it works:**
- Clients who can't cancel easily simply don't show up
- Easy rescheduling means you keep the client
- Last-minute cancellations are better than no-shows

## Strategy 4: Waitlist Management

Turn cancellations into opportunities.

**How to implement:**
- Maintain a waitlist for popular time slots
- Automatically notify waitlist when slots open
- Offer incentives for filling last-minute slots

## Strategy 5: Client History Tracking

Track no-show patterns and take action.

**What to track:**
- Individual client no-show rates
- Time slots with highest no-show rates
- Services with highest no-show rates
- Seasonal patterns

**Actions to take:**
- Require deposits from repeat offenders
- Double-book known no-show slots
- Adjust booking policies for high-risk times
