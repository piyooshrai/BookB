BookB's comprehensive staff management features help Cardiff salons optimize team productivity and deliver consistent excellent service every day. Staff scheduling creates weekly rotas accounting for availability, time-off requests, and skill levels ensuring adequate coverage during busy Cardiff shopping days and quieter midweek periods.
