BookB provides mobile-optimized online booking that works perfectly on Bristol buses, in harbourside cafes, and anywhere clients access their smartphones throughout the day and evening.

              <p>

Revenue reporting breaks down income by service category, retail products, individual stylists, and time periods for deep understanding of business performance across different seasons and economic conditions.
