              <h3>Service Checkout Built for Salons</h3>
              <p>
                Generic POS systems designed for retail stores don't understand salon service operations where stylists perform treatments, recommend products, track tips separately, and split commissions. BookB's salon POS handles these complexities naturally matching how your business actually works. Service checkout flows from appointment completion through payment in intuitive steps staff learn quickly without extensive training. Add services performed during appointments automatically populated from booking details saving manual entry time and preventing errors. Modify services if appointments changed from original booking adding extra treatments or removing services client declined. Product recommendations appear contextually based on services performed suggesting relevant retail items clients likely need. Adjust pricing for service upgrades, senior stylists, or promotional discounts applied appropriately throughout checkout process. Split services between multiple stylists crediting assistants for shampooing or color application while lead stylist receives primary service commission. Apply packages and memberships automatically deducting from prepaid balances when clients redeem included services as part of programs. Redeem gift cards entering codes and applying balances toward service totals with remaining balances tracked for future visits. Accept tips separately from service payments allocating to individual service providers or splitting according to your salon tip policies. Handle multiple payment methods when clients pay partially with gift card, cash for tips, and credit for remaining balance. Generate detailed receipts showing services performed, products purchased, payments received, and remaining gift card or package balances clearly. Email receipts automatically to client email addresses on file for paperless records and expense tracking convenience. Print receipts when clients request physical copies or require documentation for health spending accounts or insurance reimbursement submissions.

              <h3>Retail Sales Integrated with Services</h3>
              <p>
                Salons generate significant revenue from retail product sales, requiring POS systems treating retail as important as services, not afterthoughts. BookB integrates retail seamlessly into checkout workflow encouraging upsells while tracking inventory and profitability. Product catalog organizes your retail inventory by category, brand, and product type for quick location during checkout conversations. Barcode scanning speeds checkout when products have UPC codes printed eliminating manual search and entry reducing transaction time. Product recommendations suggest items based on services performed matching shampoos, conditioners, and styling products to treatments clients received. Quantity discounts apply automatically when clients purchase multiple items encouraging larger basket sizes through promotional pricing tiers. Inventory deduction happens automatically when products sell preventing stockouts from invisible depletion not tracked manually. Cost of goods sold tracking deducts product costs from revenue showing true profitability margins by product category and brand. Low stock alerts notify managers when inventory approaches reorder points preventing running out of popular items during busy periods. Product performance reports identify bestsellers worthy of prominent display and slow movers occupying valuable shelf space without generating returns. Staff product knowledge tracking records which team members successfully attach retail to services identifying training needs and top performers. Commission structures for retail sales can differ from services reflecting different margins and sales effort required for product recommendations. Bundle pricing creates product sets like color care packages combining shampoo, conditioner, and treatment at discounted rates. Gift sets assemble products attractively for holiday and special occasion sales when clients purchase gifts for others. Product education materials link to usage instructions, ingredient information, and styling videos helping clients maximize value and results. Returns and exchanges process smoothly restocking inventory and adjusting financial records when clients aren't satisfied with product purchases.

              <h3>Payment Processing That Understands Salons</h3>
              <p>
                Salon payment scenarios differ from typical retail requiring POS systems handling tips, split payments, refunds, and service-specific situations. BookB's payment processing accommodates real salon payment needs without forcing workarounds designed for different industries. Integrated payment processing accepts credit cards, debit cards, contactless payments, and mobile wallets through competitive transparent rates. Tip handling adds gratuity to card transactions allocating to individual service providers or splitting according to salon policies. Credit card tips process as separate transactions or add to service totals depending on your accounting and payroll preferences. Split payment accepts multiple payment methods when clients pay with combinations of cash, cards, gift cards, and membership credits. Partial payments allow deposits for future appointments or installment payments for expensive service packages purchased upfront. Refunds process smoothly for service dissatisfaction, pricing errors, or package cancellations with funds returning to original payment methods. Authorization holds secure payment methods for appointments requiring deposits preventing no-shows while not charging until services complete. Recurring billing charges membership fees automatically each month without requiring manual processing or client payment method entry. Package expiration credits refund unused services when prepaid packages expire beyond reasonable redemption periods per consumer protection requirements. Payment plans spread expensive treatments like hair extensions or keratin series across multiple billing cycles making services accessible. Terminal flexibility supports countertop terminals for reception checkout and mobile readers for stylists collecting payment at their stations. Payment security maintains PCI compliance through encrypted processing and tokenization protecting client payment data from breaches. Chargeback management provides documentation for disputed transactions helping fight fraudulent claims and understand legitimate dissatisfaction patterns.

              <h3>Commission Tracking and Reporting</h3>
              <p>
                Salon staff compensation often includes commission on services and retail requiring POS systems calculating earnings accurately and transparently. BookB tracks commissions automatically ensuring staff get paid correctly while providing management visibility into compensation costs. Service commission calculates percentages based on service revenue applying tiered rates when stylists earn higher percentages after reaching productivity thresholds. Retail commission applies different percentages to product sales reflecting different margins and recognition that retail requires separate sales effort. Split commission divides earnings between lead stylists and assistants fairly crediting both participants for their contributions to service delivery. Product cost deductions subtract consumables used during services from commission calculations ensuring stylists share responsibility for cost control. Override commission handles situations where salon owners perform services or managers cover for staff absences with appropriate compensation structures. Commission holds delay payment on services until clients complete payment preventing commission on services that get refunded or disputed. Tip reporting tracks gratuities received by each staff member generating required documentation for tax reporting and payroll processing. Earnings visibility lets stylists check current period income through mobile apps helping them understand performance toward goals. Payroll reporting generates commission data formatted for payroll providers including gross earnings, deductions, and hours worked for pay calculation. Historical earnings analysis shows income trends over time helping stylists understand seasonality and performance patterns affecting their compensation. Goal tracking compares current performance to targets motivating productivity improvements through transparent measurement of progress toward compensation levels. Commission disputes resolve through transaction history providing clear documentation of services performed, prices charged, and commission calculations applied. Compensation forecasting projects earnings based on scheduled appointments helping stylists understand upcoming pay and adjust availability accordingly.

              <h3>Financial Reporting for Salon Owners</h3>
              <p>
                Understanding salon financial performance requires reporting going beyond simple sales totals to profitability analysis, trends, and actionable insights. BookB provides comprehensive financial reporting helping salon owners make data-driven business decisions. Daily sales summaries show total revenue broken down by services, retail, tips, and payment methods for quick performance snapshots. Revenue by service category identifies which treatments generate most income helping optimize service menu and marketing focus toward profitable offerings. Stylist performance compares revenue generation across team members identifying top producers and underperformers needing coaching or schedule adjustments. Retail performance analyzes product sales by category, brand, and individual SKU showing what's selling and what's not moving. Payment method breakdown shows how clients pay informing decisions about accepting new payment types or promoting specific methods. Refund analysis tracks service dissatisfaction patterns identifying quality issues, pricing problems, or staff performance concerns requiring attention. Discount analysis measures promotional effectiveness showing whether discounts drive sufficient volume to justify reduced margins on services. Package sales performance tracks prepaid revenue, redemption rates, and expiration patterns informing package design and marketing strategies. Gift card analysis shows cards sold, redeemed, and outstanding liability helping manage this important revenue source and marketing tool. Time-based analysis compares performance across days, weeks, months, and years identifying trends, seasonality, and growth trajectories. Profitability analysis deducts costs including staff compensation, product costs, and overhead from revenue showing true profit margins. Budget comparison tracks actual performance against financial goals and budgets helping identify variances requiring corrective action or plan adjustments. Tax reporting generates data formatted for accountants and tax preparation including sales tax collected, exempt sales, and revenue categories.
